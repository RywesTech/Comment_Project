This semester of Computer Science builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. Through a project-based approach, students have worked towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language.
Elon has stellar performance in work ethic, and perseverance. Average performance in asking for help. Poor performance in generosity. Terrible performance in collaboration. He works in a focused manner outside and inside of class.
The workload of this semester is more difficult than the previous one, because we are learning knowledge to prepare for the AP exam. For now, Elon has an overall grade of B+, which shows a decent understanding of the materials we covered in the semester. In the final cumulative test, he got 72%.
We also did some patner projects this semester. Students are randomly paired, and the pairs have about a week to use the knowledge we have learned so far to create a project together. Among the three partner projects we did, Elon got at least one project in the B range. I am not worrying too much, But I encourage him to communicate more with the partner next time.
 
Overall, this semester has been good for Elon. He has decreasing project grades and decreasing test grades. I look forward to where Elon will go in the future!
