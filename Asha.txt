This semester of Computer Science builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. Through a project-based approach, students have worked towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language.
Asha has stellar performance in collaboration, work ethic, asking for help, generosity, and perseverance. She works in a focused manner outside and inside of class.
The workload of this semester is more difficult than the previous one, because we are learning knowledge to prepare for the AP exam. For now, Asha has an overall grade of C, which shows some lack of understanding of the materials we covered in the semester. In the final cumulative test, she got 83%.
We also did some patner projects this semester. Students are randomly paired, and the pairs have about a week to use the knowledge we have learned so far to create a project together. Among the three partner projects we did, Asha got at least one C. I encourage Asha to stop by my office more often during office hour for some help. She really needs to spend more time on computer science before the AP exam comes in May!
 
Overall, this semester has been ok for Asha. She has decreasing project grades and increasing test grades. I look forward to where Asha will go in the future!
