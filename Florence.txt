This semester of Computer Science builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. Through a project-based approach, students have worked towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language.
Florence has good performance in collaboration, asking for help, and perseverance. Average performance in work ethic. Terrible performance in generosity. She is generally mean and negative towards other students in class.
The workload of this semester is more difficult than the previous one, because we are learning knowledge to prepare for the AP exam. For now, Florence has an overall grade of B, which shows a quite complete understanding of the materials we covered in the semester. In the final cumulative test, she got 78%.
We also did some patner projects this semester. Students are randomly paired, and the pairs have about a week to use the knowledge we have learned so far to create a project together. Among the three partner projects we did, Florence got at least one C. I encourage Florence to stop by my office more often during office hour for some help. She really needs to spend more time on computer science before the AP exam comes in May!
 
Overall, this semester has been good for Florence. She has increasing project grades and decreasing test grades. I look forward to where Florence will go in the future!
