This semester of Computer Science builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. Through a project-based approach, students have worked towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language.
Bill has good performance in collaboration, work ethic, asking for help, and perseverance. Poor performance in generosity. 
The workload of this semester is more difficult than the previous one, because we are learning knowledge to prepare for the AP exam. For now, Bill has an overall grade of A, which shows an excellent overal understanding of the materials we covered in the semester. In the final cumulative test, Bill gets 90%.
We also did some patner projects this semester. Students are randomly paired, and the pairs have about a week to use the knowledge we have learned so far to create a project together. Among the three partner projects we did, Bill got all of the partner projects in the A range! Excellent job! Keep working hard, Bill!
Overall, this semester has been amazing for Bill. He has increasing project grades and decreasing test grades. I look forward to where Bill will go in the future!
