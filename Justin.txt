This semester of Computer Science builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications. Through a project-based approach, students have worked towards mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language.
Justin has stellar performance in work ethic, and asking for help. Good performance in collaboration, generosity, and perseverance. They work in a focused manner outside and inside of class.
The workload of this semester is more difficult than the previous one, because we are learning knowledge to prepare for the AP exam. For now, Justin have an overall grade of B+, which shows a decent understanding of the materials we covered in the semester. In the final cumulative test, they got 92%.
We also did some patner projects this semester. Students are randomly paired, and the pairs have about a week to use the knowledge we have learned so far to create a project together. Among the three partner projects we did, Justin got at least one project in the B range. I am not worrying too much, But I encourage them to communicate more with the partner next time.
 
Overall, this semester has been good for Justin. They have decreasing project grades and increasing test grades. I look forward to where Justin will go in the future!
